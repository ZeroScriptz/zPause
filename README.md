# zPause


# What is this?

Standalone Pause Menu that is minimalistic not many animations besides a hover. Was going to go beyond and add more later but wanted to give the community some options to be able to allow this with ZeroScript first free release. 

# How to Use?

   Put in resources and ensure/start zPause. 
   
# Having issue?

  File a PR / issue. If anything this issue is caused by rename of file since you renamed the folder its not calling back the querys. 
  
  
# How to edit logo! 

 Making sure logo is 100px by 100px or 100x100 then replace the logo.png with your logo that will replace it. 
 
 # Credit when given, if you made any edits or used this to make a new menu, please give credit where needed.
 
 
 Thank you to the whole ESX Discord Community for the help towards this small yes simple pause menu.
